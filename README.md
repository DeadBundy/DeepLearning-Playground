# DeepLearning-Model-Visualization

DeepLearning-Model-Visualization is a collection of Jupyter Notebook experiments demonstrating different types of neural networks, their training and testing processes, and visualizations that highlight how models learn and improve over time.

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains executable notebooks that provide:
- Implementations of various **Neural Network architectures** (Feedforward, CNN, RNN, etc.)
- **Training and testing** of datasets with performance metrics
- **Visualization** of model learning curves, accuracy, and loss
- Insights into how neural networks adapt and generalize over epochs

All experiments were conducted using **Jupyter Notebook** in the **Anaconda environment** for seamless integration of Python libraries and reproducible results.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch (as applicable)  
- Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)
