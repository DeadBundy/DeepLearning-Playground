# DeepLearning-Model-Visualization

DeepLearning-Model-Visualization is a collection of Jupyter Notebook experiments demonstrating different types of neural networks, their training and testing processes, and visualizations that highlight how models learn and improve over time.

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains executable notebooks that provide:
- Implementations of various **Neural Network architectures** (Feedforward, CNN, RNN, etc.)
- **Training and testing** of datasets with performance metrics
- **Visualization** of model learning curves, accuracy, and loss
- Insights into how neural networks adapt and generalize over epochs

All experiments were conducted using **Jupyter Notebook** in the **Anaconda environment** for seamless integration of Python libraries and reproducible results.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch (as applicable)  
- Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NeuroViz.git
   cd NeuroViz
2.Launch Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda)
  jupyter notebook
3.Open and run the notebooks
  In the Jupyter interface, open the desired .ipynb file.
  Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the results and visualizations.
